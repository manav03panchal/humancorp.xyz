# MDX Stress Test

This post tests every markdown feature to make sure our blog styling holds up.

## Code Blocks

Here's some JavaScript:

```javascript
const humancorp = {
  name: 'Humancorp',
  mission: 'Building cool shit',
  principles: ['local-first', 'open-source', 'no-bullshit']
};

async function buildTheFuture() {
  const ideas = await generateIdeas();
  const code = await writeCode(ideas);
  return ship(code);
}

// This is a comment
buildTheFuture().then(console.log);
```

And some TypeScript with types:

```typescript
interface Project {
  name: string;
  status: 'active' | 'beta' | 'deprecated';
  stars: number;
}

const projects: Project[] = [
  { name: 'humanboard', status: 'beta', stars: 420 },
  { name: 'humantime', status: 'active', stars: 1337 },
  { name: 'nexus', status: 'active', stars: 69 }
];

function getActiveProjects(projects: Project[]): Project[] {
  return projects.filter(p => p.status === 'active');
}
```

Some Python:

```python
def train_model(data, epochs=100):
    """Train the model on local data. No cloud needed."""
    model = LocalFirstModel()

    for epoch in range(epochs):
        loss = model.fit(data)
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}: loss = {loss:.4f}")

    return model

if __name__ == "__main__":
    train_model(load_data("./local/data.csv"))
```

Inline code looks like `const x = 42` or `npm install` in a sentence.

## Lists

### Unordered List

- First item in the list
- Second item with **bold text**
- Third item with `inline code`
- Nested items:
  - Nested one
  - Nested two
  - Nested three
- Back to top level

### Ordered List

1. First step: Clone the repo
2. Second step: Install dependencies
3. Third step: Run the dev server
4. Fourth step: Ship it
5. Fifth step: Profit (optional)

## Blockquotes

> Software should work for you, not against you. We build open source software. No subscriptions. No vendor lock-in. No bullshit.

And a longer quote:

> The future isn't massive corporations with thousands of engineers. It's small teams of 2-5 people building things that matter. Why hire 50 people when 5 people with AI can move faster, iterate quicker, and stay focused?

## Text Formatting

This is **bold text** and this is *italic text* and this is ***bold italic***.

You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ if needed.

Here's a [link to GitHub](https://github.com) in the middle of text.

## Headings

### This is H3

Some content under H3.

#### This is H4

Some content under H4.

##### This is H5

Some content under H5.

## Horizontal Rule

Content above the line.

---

Content below the line.

## Tables

| Feature | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Local-first storage | Done | High |
| AI integration | In Progress | High |
| Cloud sync (optional) | Planned | Low |
| Mobile app | Planned | Medium |

## Mixed Content

Here's a complex section with multiple elements:

1. **Step one**: Run this command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/humancorp/project.git
   cd project
   npm install
   ```

2. **Step two**: Configure the environment:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Set `DATABASE_URL` to your local path
   - Set `AI_PROVIDER` to your preferred option

3. **Step three**: Start building:
   > Remember: Every line of code we write is public. Fork it. Modify it. Make it yours.
